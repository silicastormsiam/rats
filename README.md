## 📂 Repo Structure (WIP)

| File/Folder | Purpose                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `README.md` | You're reading it                            |
| `/data/`    | Sample job feeds, JSON mocks                 |
| `/prompts/` | Prompt templates for AI auto-matching        |
| `/scripts/` | Collection tools and parsers                 |
| `/docs/`    | Architecture plans and mockups (coming soon) |

---

## 🧪 Sample Use Case

```plaintext
1. User configures job alert parameters: [Remote | Frontend | Thailand | $100k+]
2. RATS begins scanning LinkedIn, StackOverflow, Wellfound, etc.
3. Matches are stored, tagged, and filtered by relevance score.
4. Top matches are sent daily or in real-time via Telegram/Email.
5. Optional: Resume auto-submitted through direct APIs or form automation.
```

## 📌 Compliance Notes

* **Repo Standard:** ✅ Aligned with folder, file, and metadata requirements.
* **Required PMI Docs:** ❌ Missing — Project Charter to be created in `/docs/Initiation/`.
* **ReadMe Maintenance:** Reviewed and tagged for update cycle in sync with monthly archive policy.

---

If you want, I can now create the **`Project Charter`** in `/docs/Initiation/` in full PMI/CAPM format so that R.A.T.S. hits 100% compliance on the next pass. That would complete the Repo Standard process for this repo.

Do you want me to start that document now?
